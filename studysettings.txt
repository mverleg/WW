remove confusion due to multiple uses of the name "active"
might need to store current mode somewhere too


*** PROFILE ****
to and from language!
answer type (multiple choice, tritten, review-only, ...)
? what to ask/reveal (image, written to/from, phonetic to/from, sound to/from)
    can depend on score, or each with a probability
auto-play audio? (during test, mute button), max audio
which shower, activator, scorer etc
which statistics on test screen?
which buttons on test screen?
CACHE current card etc


*** SCORER ***
bookkeeping of scores (multiple profiles can share score)
limit consecutive updates in one day
what counts as learned
cache_expired flag (need_active_update)


*** ACTIVATOR ***
should have a name if you can choose multiple
how many unlearned cards
which categories / priorities


*** SHOWER ***
should have a name if you can choose multiple
minimum repeat delay
probability of high vs low score cards
increase prob if not shown for a long time
filters (correct/incorrect count, score, how long ago, length, votes)
repeat incorrect ones quickly?


if I want to repeat wrongly answered cards within X turns, I could keep a list into the future at least that long (that'll also take care of not asking the same card again within X, but maybe this X shouldn't be the same)
what about going back and forth in the cards? I have the results in DB so should be easy server-side, but maybe users should just check the score screen instead
measure how long each card takes?


Split score depending on what is shown
Always store score etc on learning language, not on phrase, since you might learn the same phrase in multiple languages
Maybe make the ask/reveal settings a model that has a M2M relation, and then have a chooser which either alternates them, chooses a random one or lets it depend on the card score (or a combination? probabilities change as score increases? well, can always add a class for that)
    UPDATE: maybe no seperate class is needed, since the number of options is finite (and fairly limited)
    show examples (can only be afterwards?)
What about studying a specific list?
How exactly is a card activated (in the part-of-phrases-being-shown set)? -> create ActiveTranslation
