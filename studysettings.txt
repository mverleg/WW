remove confusion due to multiple uses of the name "active"
might need to store current display mode somewhere too
split score depending on what is shown!!
score kept separately based on what is revealed (using mode hash perhaps)
test DisplayMode.hash and __str__


*** PROFILE ****
to and from language!
answer type (multiple choice, tritten, review-only, ...)
? what to ask/reveal (image, written to/from, phonetic to/from, sound to/from)
    can depend on score, or each with a probability
auto-play audio? (during test, mute button), max audio
which shower, activator, scorer etc
which statistics on test screen?
which buttons on test screen?
CACHE current card etc


*** SCORER ***
bookkeeping of scores (multiple profiles can share score)
limit consecutive updates in one day
what counts as learned
cache_expired flag (need_active_update)
more or less score depending on ask direction


*** ACTIVATOR ***
should have a name if you can choose multiple
how many unlearned cards
which categories / priorities


*** SHOWER ***
should have a name if you can choose multiple
minimum repeat delay
probability of high vs low score cards
increase prob if not shown for a long time
filters (correct/incorrect count, score, how long ago, length, votes)
repeat incorrect ones quickly?



measure how long each card takes?
Always store score etc on learning language translation, not on phrase, since you might learn the same phrase in multiple languages
What about studying a specific list?
How exactly is a card activated (in the part-of-phrases-being-shown set)? -> create ActiveTranslation
